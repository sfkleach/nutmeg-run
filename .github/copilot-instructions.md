# Nutmeg-Run

This is a GNU C++ project that implements a threaded interpreter for the
Nutmeg programming language. The interpreter is based on a stack machine
partially implemented in https://github.com/sfkleach/poppy

## Collaboration Guidelines

When providing technical assistance:

- **Be objective and critical**: Focus on technical correctness over agreeability
- **Challenge assumptions**: If code has clear technical flaws, point them out directly
- **Prioritize correctness**: Don't compromise on proper implementation to avoid disagreement
- **Think through implications**: Consider how users will actually use features in practice
- **Be direct about problems**: If something is wrong or will cause user confusion, say so clearly

The goal is to build robust, well-designed software, not to avoid technical disagreements.

## Programming Guidelines

- Comments should be proper sentences, with correct grammar and punctuation,
  including the use of capitalization and periods.
- Where defensive checks are added, include a comment explaining why they are
  appropriate (not necessary, since defensive checks are not necessary).

## Programming Style Guidelines

- I prefer text files to use new-line as a terminator rather than a separator
  i.e. newlines at the end of non-empty files.
- And lines should not have trailing whitespace.
- We use 120 as the maximum line-length and not 80 characters. The detailed guideline
  is that the length first-to-last non-whitespace character should be 80 characters
  and that an additional 40 characters of indentation is allowed.
